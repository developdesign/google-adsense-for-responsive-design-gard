GARD (Google AdSense for Responsive Design) allows you to easily place Google AdSense in your website's content via the use of a shortcode. 

== Description ==

GARD allows you to easily place Google AdSense in your website's content via the use of the shortcode [GARD]. 

Set up is easy, simply create AdSense ads for the different sizes that you want to use on your website, then input the AdSense google_ad_slot number into the GARD settings page next to that ads dimension. That's it!
