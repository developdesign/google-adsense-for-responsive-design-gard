GARD (Google AdSense for Responsive Design) allows you to easily place Google AdSense in your website's content via the use of a shortcode.

== Description ==

GARD allows you to easily place responsive Google AdSense in your website's content via the use of the shortcode [GARD], custom shortcode option available in [GARD Pro](http://thedigitalhippies.com/gardpro "GARD Pro: Google Adsense for Responsive Design Pro").

The inserted ads will never excede the content area width, and will select the right size ad to show depending on which ads you have provided GARD to pick from.

GARD does not resize ads on the fly, because most users don't resize their browsers while viewing your website. Instead on initial page load, it determins the optimal ad for that position, and shows that ad.

Setup is easy. Create AdSense ads for the different sizes that you want to use on your website, then input the AdSense google_ad_slot number into the GARD settings page next to that ads dimension. That's it!

[GARD Pro](http://thedigitalhippies.com/gardpro "GARD Pro: Google Adsense for Responsive Design Pro") extends the capabilities of GARD by allowing things like customizing the shortcode, auto insert GARD into posts & pages, and a responsive widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need my own AdSense account to make this work? =

Yes.

= Do I have to create ads for every size? =

No. You will only need to create an ad for each size that you want displayed. Feel free to leave the field(s) blank to skip that size.

= How do you prevent GARD from displaying more than 3 ads on one page? =

Google will not allow more than three AdSense ads to load per page. GARD cannot show more, even if you wanted it to.  
[Google content ad limit per page](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1346295?hl=en "Google content ad limit per page"): If you place more than one ad unit on a page, our system will display unique ads to each ad unit. Because the system automatically displays an optimal number of highly targeted Google ads on each page, in some cases, the maximum number of ads may not always appear.

= Can I change the shortcode text? =

Yes, with [GARD Pro](http://thedigitalhippies.com/gardpro "GARD Pro: Google Adsense for Responsive Design Pro"). (See "What are the GARD Pro Features" below.)

= Can I use GARD in widget areas? =
